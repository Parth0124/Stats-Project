## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze the demographics of asylum seekers and predict future trends using machine learning techniques. The focus is on understanding the factors influencing asylum applications and how they change over time.

## Datasets
The project utilizes three main datasets:
1. **`demographics.csv`**: Contains demographic information of asylum seekers, including age and gender distributions.
2. **`asylum_seekers_monthly.csv`**: Monthly asylum application data used for time series analysis.
3. **`resettlement.csv`**: Information related to the resettlement of asylum seekers.
